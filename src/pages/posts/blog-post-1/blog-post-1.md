Hi, my name is Codee. I am a full-stack developer currently based in Austin, Texas. The purpose of this blog is to share ideas and start conversations about technology.

As a developer and dancer I use my deeply engrained passion for mastering new techniques to bridge the gap between technology and art. I will be sharing my experiences and ideas here.

I have developed full-stack applications in the MERN and Django stacks, and I am currently exploring the JAM stack. I recently completed the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly in Austin, and will be writing about my experience there.
